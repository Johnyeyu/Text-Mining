# Text-Mining

Our objective is to analyse the sentiment/main theme of a particular textual document, in this case, an interview.
We will use some basic text mining operators to classify the data in regards to the key words present within the textual document. The key words used in the text should enable us to predict the key sentiments attached to the text.
